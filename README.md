For this capstone project, the team  goal is to implement a chatbot application on AWS in a secure and automated manner by leveraging a DevOps approach. Specifically, we aim to design and configure a secure automated CI/CD pipeline that integrates security measures throughout the entire application lifecycle. This will enable us to deliver a secure and reliable chatbot application faster by automating the integration of security practices into the development of the chatbot.

The key objective is to successfully implement a chatbot development workflow that incorporates secure automated processes, which will be achieved through the implementation of a secure automated CI/CD pipeline.
